Different projects involving data visualization

A/B testing: I used ANOVA & Tukey's test to determine which promotion did the best in sales

Biodiversity: Some observations from the National parks service

Life Expectancy & GDP: I analyzed data from 6 countries during 2000-2015 and drew some conclusions about life expectancy and national GDP. I used different types of plotting to visualize different types of data and the relations between the parameters.

Netflix visualizations: Analysing Netflix Stocks, some examples were:
- The distribution of the stock prices for the past year
- Netflix's earnings and revenue in the last four quarters
- The actual vs. estimated earnings per share for the four quarters in 2017
- A comparison of the Netflix Stock price vs the Dow Jones Industrial Average price in 2017
